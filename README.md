CSS List Documentation Framework
--------------------------------

## Overview

A simple, lightweight HTML/CSS mini 'framework' of sorts to allow for quick and easy documentation of
procedures/techniques that entail multiple, sometimes in-depth steps to complete, using a nested list structure with
 uniquely-labelled sections and bullet-points.

## Details

* Uses nested unorded lists that are styled so that the character used for each item in the lists' bullet is logical
 with respect to the level of nesting in the documentation

* Nesting lists within lists, following the flow of the process/procedure/techniuqe being documented,
no matter what level in the heirarchy, will result in a visually and procedurally logical document structure

* Steps/nodes in the documented are easily and accurately referenceable, for example, "go to section B, step 3.b.ii"
