CSS Documentation Framework
---------------------------

## Overview

A simple lightweight CSS 'framework' of sorts to allow for quick and easy documentation of procedures/techniques that enatail multiple, sometimes in-depth steps to complete.

## Details

* Uses nested unorded lists that are styled so that the character used for each item in the lists' bullet is logical with respect to the level of nesting in the documentation

* Nesting lists within lists, following the flow of the process/procedure/techniuqe being documented, no matter what level in the heirarchy, will result in a visually and procedurally logical document structure

* Steps/nodes in the documented are easily and accurately referenceable, for example, "go to section B, step 3.b.ii"
